- **Project Showcase**: Displays a curated list of projects, including descriptions, technologies used, and links to the live projects or repositories.
- **Skills & Experience**: Highlights my skills and professional experience to showcase my expertise and achievements.
- **Contact Form**: Includes a contact form through which visitors can get in touch with me directly.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine:

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Node.js (v12 or higher) and npm installed on your system.

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/shubhamm69/Shubham-Portfolio
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies by running:

    ```
    cd Shubham-Portfolio
    ```
    ```
    npm install
    ```

4. **Configure MongoDB**: Set up a MongoDB instance or use an existing one. Update the MongoDB connection settings in the appropriate configuration file (if applicable) to ensure the site can connect to the database.

5. **Environment Variables**: Create a `.env` file at the root of the project and add any necessary environment variables. Make sure to include any sensitive information in this file, and add it to your `.gitignore` to keep it from being committed to version control.

6. **Run the Development Server**: Start the development server by running the following command:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    ```

   The site should now be running locally at `http://localhost:3000`.
